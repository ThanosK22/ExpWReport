This is the code repository for my ExpW lab report. 
Code: 
  - FFT_Tube: FFT performed on the Tube data
  - FFT_Tube_Loop: Looping through the Tube data to calculate the speed of sound
  - FFT_Cube: FFT and peak prediction on the cube data
  - FFT_Cyldinder: FFT and peak prediction on the cylinder data
  - Sweeps: Comparison of two different sweeps, degeneracy breaking
